        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was one of the few Khans of [PAWN_possessive] tribe who often spent extended periods of time far away from the camp. [PAWN_pronoun] was a chem runner, tasked with delivering the tribe’s products to their clients, be they raiders, doctors or caravan outfits. Due to the value of [PAWN_possessive] goods, [PAWN_nameDef] had to be shrewd and cunning to evade rival chem dealers, as well as desperate addicts looking for a fix.</description>

        <description>An esteemed and wise warrior, [PAWN_nameDef] was an advisor to the tribe’s leader. [PAWN_pronoun] was unusually level-headed for a Khan and advised against rushed and overly violent actions, which some of the younger warriors saw as a sign of weakness. Nevertheless, [PAWN_pronoun] was a more than capable warrior and always acted with the wellbeing of the tribe in mind.</description>

Their sturdiness was testament to [PAWN_possessive] skills and [PAWN_pronoun] was greatly valued by [PAWN_possessive] tribe.</description>

        <description>While they essentially still were raiders, the Khans were always on the lookout for allies to aid them in their struggle against the NCR. [PAWN_nameDef] was well-spoken and refined (for a Khan anyway) and was often tasked with negotiations, be they military alliances or trade agreements.</description>

        <description>The Great Khans had a propensity for paranoia, which was no surprise considering their recent history.

While [PAWN_pronoun] was an adequate fighter, [PAWN_pronoun] knew very well that the Khans lacked both numbers and training to put up a real fight against the NCR.</description>

        <description>As a child [PAWN_nameDef] was a survivor of a tribe eradicated by a ruthless group of raiders. [PAWN_pronoun] was found and taken in by a group of Khans who happened upon the smouldering ruins of [PAWN_possessive] village. [PAWN_possessive] tribal knowledge about the plants and animals of the wasteland served the Khans well.</description>

        <description>The Great Khans relaxed attitude towards their offspring’s upbringing often led to risky or outright dangerous games and activities the children participated in. [PAWN_nameDef] was known as one of the most daring children of [PAWN_possessive] tribe. [PAWN_pronoun] greatly enjoyed taunting tribe’s bighorners and similar games of questionable pedagogic value.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was born small and weak. Few Khan Children with these attributes survive their early childhood, either because of the harsh living conditions or because they are killed outright since a weak child would not survive the brutal initiation rites anyway. [PAWN_nameDef], however, endured and even prospered, a testament to [PAWN_possessive] tenacity.</description>

        <description>While most Khans preferred to live in yurts, many built their camps near caves. While this might seem primitive, even for the Khans, natural caves made easily defendable homes and were usually much less prone to collapse compared to pre-war ruins. [PAWN_nameDef] grew up in and around an extensive cave system and helped expand it, if needed.</description>
